# javascript and classes (technically abhi bhi nahi hoti hai classes )
# JavaScript does have a class keyword that was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6). However, it's essential to understand that JavaScript's class mechanism is syntactic sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance system. In other words, JavaScript's "classes" are a way to create constructor functions and prototypes in a more familiar, object-oriented syntax. Underneath the class syntax, JavaScript is still using prototypal inheritance. The class keyword provides a more structured and familiar way for developers who come from class-based languages to work with object-oriented concepts in JavaScript.In summary, while JavaScript has a class keyword, it's important to recognize that the language itself is prototype-based, and classes in JavaScript are a higher-level abstraction built on top of prototypes.

## oop

## object  
- collection of properties and methos
- toLowerCase,promise etc.

## why we use oop 


## parts of OOP
object literal 

- constructor function
-  prototypes
- classes 
- instances / new keyword ,this keyword


## 4 pillors  (use or learn from other resources.)
- abstraction
- encapsulation
- inheritance
- poltmorphism

# if we talk about this i.e current context 

# new keyword is constructor function ,it allowes you to create multiple instatance from one object but some situation we need a new instance so for that new keyword is udes for creating new context.

# whenever we use new keyword 
- step-1 create new object
- step-2 constructr function call because of new keyword 
- setp-3 this keyword , arguments injected to this keyword
- step-4 you will get that data on function call.
